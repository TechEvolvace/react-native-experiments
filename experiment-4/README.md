# React Native Experiment 4
For this experiment, I will develop an app to display any number of products and handle checkout of any selected product, similar to an supermarket app! 

This app will be primarily use React Native to be usable as a mobile app. This app will also primarily use Expo Go to test whether this app is successfully loaded on an iOS device.
