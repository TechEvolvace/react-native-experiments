# React Native Experiment 3
This experiment investigates creating a React Native app compatible with Expo Go that should only have JavaScript files and not TypeScript files!

This app will be a multi-page app with an intuitive navbar with navigation button that displays their corresponding pages for the app, just like for the React Native app in Experiment 2.

## My Findings

### Creating the React Native app compatible with Expo Go and only with JavaScript files instead of TypeScript files!
1) Run the command ```npx create-expo-app my-app --template blank``` in Terminal, where the ```my-app``` is the name for the new directory to contain the new React Native app.
2) Move to the new directory with the ```cd``` Terminal command. 
3) While inside the new directory containing the new React Native app, run the command ```npx expo start``` in Terminal.
