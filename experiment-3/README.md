# React Native Experiment 3
This experiment investigates creating a React Native app compatible with Expo Go that should only have JavaScript files and not TypeScript files!

This app will be a multi-page app with an intuitive navbar with navigation button that displays their corresponding pages for the app, just like for the React Native app in Experiment 2.
