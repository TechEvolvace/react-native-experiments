# React Native Experiment 5
In this experiment, I will implement customized animated page transitions whenever the user navigates to a different page in a new multi-page React Native app.

The theme in this experiment is to explore every facets of my varied collection of interests: composing music, building robots, developing software, playing chess, and creating art.
