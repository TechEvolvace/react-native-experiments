# React Native Experiment 5
In this experiment, I will implement customized animated page transitions whenever the user navigates to a different page in a new multi-page React Native app.

The theme in this experiment is to explore every facets of my varied collection of interests: composing music, building robots, developing software, playing chess, and creating art.

## New Pages
* Landing page (Display welcome message and overall hub interface for this experiment's React Native app!)
* Music Hobby (Page transition animation involves music in some form)
* Robotics Hobby (Page transition animation involves robotics in some form)
* Software Development Hobby (Page transition animation involves software development and programming in some form)
* Chess Hobby (Page transition animation involves chess in some form)
* Creating Art (Page transition animation involves art tools or equipment in some form)
